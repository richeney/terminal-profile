# Terminal Profile

Based on v0.3 from the store. Note that the svg files are not currently supported.

* Resize pane using ctrl+alt and cursor keys
* Focus pane using alt and cursor keys

The default directory for me is:

```text
/mnt/c/Users/richeney/AppData/Local/Packages/Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe/RoamingState
```

I set this to $TERMINALDIR in my .bashrc. 

Note that your username and UWP install directory will be different.
